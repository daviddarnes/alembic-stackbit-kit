# Starter kit for [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) on Stackbit

This is a very simple starting point if you wish to use Alembic [as a Jekyll theme gem](https://alembic.darn.es/#as-a-jekyll-theme) on Stackbit.

[![Create with Stackbit](https://assets.stackbit.com/badge/create-with-stackbit.svg)](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-stackbit-kit)

### Pick your Headless CMS

The included [stackbit.yaml](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/stackbit-yaml/) file defines a universal content model for your content, front matter and data. Stackbit can automatically connect this theme to CMS like Contentful, DatoCMS, Forestry, Netlify CMS, etc.
